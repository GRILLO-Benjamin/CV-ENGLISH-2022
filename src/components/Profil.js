      <p>
        After more than 15 years in catering and management, the COVID crisis
        made me go back to France, where I decided to learn about Web
        Development since the catering business was in declain. As the situation
        seems to be returning to normal, I'm open to opportunities in both field
        since I want to go back to Asia.
